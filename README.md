Coding Language: Java  

Problem 1 - Simple Calculator  
- Class to represent a calculator with two numbers and an operation type  
- Constructor initializes values for `a`, `b`, and `operation`  
- Method `calculate()` performs the selected arithmetic operation  
- Switch case handles `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`  
- Division by zero is checked before performing division  
- Exception thrown if an invalid operation is entered  
- Main method handles user input and displays result  

Problem 2 - Odd Number Series (First N Odd Numbers)  
- Program to print first N odd numbers starting from 1  
- Formula for nth odd number is `(2 * i - 1)`  
- Loop runs from `i = 1` to `N` to generate odd numbers  
- Avoids trailing comma in output formatting  

Problem 3 - Odd Number Series with Even Handling  
- Checks if the given number is even, if yes reduces it to previous odd number  
- Prints odd numbers from 1 up to the final odd limit  
- Uses step increment of 2 in loop to generate odd numbers  
- Avoids trailing comma in output formatting  

Problem 4 - Count Multiples in a List  
- Stores numbers in an integer array  
- Loops from 1 to 9 to check divisibility count for each number  
- Uses nested loop to check multiples in the list  
- Stores results in a `LinkedHashMap` to maintain insertion order  
- Displays counts for each number from 1 to 9
